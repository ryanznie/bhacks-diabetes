This is a partially successful attempt at our intended goal of creating an app that would allow the user
to sign up for an account where they can input their answers to a series of questions that we screened out
from a medical database to determine whether or not they are at risk of certain health conditions.

In this file, we have the main.py where we run the code and we were able to develop an interactive user interface
where the user can sign up or login if they've signed up previously and logout from their accounts

They can also choose to visit their profile, the risks tab or edit their patient history but we were unable to 
access the database that the data was stored in to relay it to our machine learning code that ran that statistical analysis
