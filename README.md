Problem:____

Diabetes affects ~10% of the world population and can drastically affect the public health of the lower socioeconomic class with the high cost of insulin in the United States.

Our goal is to make your own medical history and medicines more accessible to you, the patient. Our proposal is a medical profile which will monitor your risk for diabetes, your medical history, your medicines, and upcoming appointments -- all in one page. The website will use machine learning to continuously evaluate your risk for diabetes and provide patients who are at risk with suggestions to lifestyle changes. We plan to use this website to bring more awareness to diabetes and to promote healthier lifestyles.

To help you understand a little more about diabetes, below are some quick facts from [MedlinePlus](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventdiabetes.html).

### You are at risk for diabetes if you...
- Have prediabetes, which means you have blood sugar levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes
- Are overweight or obese
- Are age 45 or older
- Have a family history of diabetes
- Are African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander
- Have high blood pressure
- Have a low level of HDL (good) cholesterol or a high level of triglycerides
- Have a history of diabetes in pregnancy
- Have given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more
- Have an inactive lifestyle

### How you can prevent/delay type 2 diabetes...
- Losing weight and keeping it off. Weight control is an important part of diabetes prevention. You may be able to prevent or delay diabetes by losing 5 to 10% of your current weight. For example, if you weigh 200 pounds, your goal would be to lose between 10 to 20 pounds. And once you lose the weight, it is important that you don't gain it back.
- Following a healthy eating plan. It is important to reduce the amount of calories you eat and drink each day, so you can lose weight and keep it off. To do that, your diet should include smaller portions and less fat and sugar. You should also eat a variety of foods from each food group, including plenty of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. It's also a good idea to limit red meat, and avoid processed meats.
- Get regular exercise. Exercise has many health benefits, including helping you to lose weight and lower your blood sugar levels. These both lower your risk of type 2 diabetes. Try to get at least 30 minutes of physical activity 5 days a week. If you have not been active, talk with your health care professional to figure out which types of exercise are best for you. You can start slowly and work up to your goal.
- Don't smoke. Smoking can contribute to insulin resistance, which can lead to type 2 diabetes. If you already smoke, try to quit.
- Talk to your health care provider to see whether there is anything else you can do to delay or to prevent type 2 diabetes. If you are at high risk, your provider may suggest that you take one of a few types of diabetes medicines.
