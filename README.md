Problem:____

Our goal is to create a patient centered, personal electronic medical record system to keep track of all of the health information. Our inspiration stems from our recognition of how many patients see multiple providers and different facilities, but all of the different facilities have different pictures or profiles on the patient, making it hard to keep track of the true and updated information. Especially in elderly patients, it becomes impossible to keep track of long lists of medications and all the doctor visits. We propose that a good way to combat this is to create a organizational system where the patient and or care takers keep tracks of their own data (additional development would include the contributions of providers and methods of sending data over to other servers where systems of verifying whether the data is accurate would be needed since the patient input is subjective). In addition, this web-app is also able to calculate the risk percentage for certain diseases by comparing the patient data to an open-source dataset. The website will use machine learning to continuously evaluate your risk for certain diseases and will serve as a way of disease prevention. We plan to use this website to make keeping track of one's health less stressful to promote healthier lifestyles.

To demonstrate the machine learning, A diabetes risk calculator was created. Diabetes affects ~10% of the world population and can drastically affect the public health of the lower socioeconomic class with the high cost of insulin in the United States.

To help you understand a little more about diabetes, below are some quick facts from [MedlinePlus](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventdiabetes.html).

### You are at risk for diabetes if you...
- Have prediabetes, which means you have blood sugar levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes
- Are overweight or obese
- Are age 45 or older
- Have a family history of diabetes
- Are African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander
- Have high blood pressure
- Have a low level of HDL (good) cholesterol or a high level of triglycerides
- Have a history of diabetes in pregnancy
- Have given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more
- Have an inactive lifestyle
- Have a history of heart disease or stroke
- Have depression
- Have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
- Have acanthosis nigricans, a skin condition in which your skin becomes dark and thick, especially around your neck or armpits
- Smoke

### How you can prevent/delay type 2 diabetes...
- Losing weight and keeping it off. Weight control is an important part of diabetes prevention. You may be able to prevent or delay diabetes by losing 5 to 10% of your current weight. For example, if you weigh 200 pounds, your goal would be to lose between 10 to 20 pounds. And once you lose the weight, it is important that you don't gain it back.
- Following a healthy eating plan. It is important to reduce the amount of calories you eat and drink each day, so you can lose weight and keep it off. To do that, your diet should include smaller portions and less fat and sugar. You should also eat a variety of foods from each food group, including plenty of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. It's also a good idea to limit red meat, and avoid processed meats.
- Get regular exercise. Exercise has many health benefits, including helping you to lose weight and lower your blood sugar levels. These both lower your risk of type 2 diabetes. Try to get at least 30 minutes of physical activity 5 days a week. If you have not been active, talk with your health care professional to figure out which types of exercise are best for you. You can start slowly and work up to your goal.
- Don't smoke. Smoking can contribute to insulin resistance, which can lead to type 2 diabetes. If you already smoke, try to quit.
- Talk to your health care provider to see whether there is anything else you can do to delay or to prevent type 2 diabetes. If you are at high risk, your provider may suggest that you take one of a few types of diabetes medicines.
